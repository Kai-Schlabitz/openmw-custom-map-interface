Compatibility 
This mod was created for OpenMW 0.49.0.
It might work with other versions, but there are no guarantees.

Description
It adds a map interface that can use up to 9 custom map textures.
The map assets in the images are the Wagner maps from https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48455?tab=description.
There are no included map assets in this mod.
When adding map assets make sure that they are compatible with OpenMW and put them in the textures folder in this mod's folder.

For example: "texture/yourMap.dds" or "texture/tamriel.tga".

Support
If you want me to implement a feature for you, I won't.
I'm sorry I can't help, but you'll need to do it yourself or get someone else to do it for you.
