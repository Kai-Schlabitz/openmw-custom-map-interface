# Custom Map Interface
Version 3

## Compatibility 
This mod was created for OpenMW 0.49.0.
It might work with other versions, but there are no guarantees.

## Description
It adds a map interface that can use up to 9 custom map textures.

## Controls and Settings
You can open the map interface by default by pressing M.
This can be changed in the settings page for the mod.
The map can be moved by dragging it or with the standard movement controls.
Zooming in and out can be done with the standard zoom controls.
You can adjust the speed of zooming and moving the map in the settings page for the mod.
Press the quick key that corresponds to the map number whose path you set in the settings page.
For example, quick key 1 opens map 1. Make sure that the path to map 1 is set in the settings.

## Support
If you want me to implement a feature for you, I won't.
I'm sorry I can't help, but you'll need to do it yourself or get someone else to do it for you.
